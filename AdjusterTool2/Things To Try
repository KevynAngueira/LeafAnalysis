Things to Try:

Original Area:
(1) Fixed Base Widths to use True Base Widths | FIXED
(2) Retrain Estimation Model with Noise | FIXED


Remaining Area:
(1) Rotation Bug | FIXED
(2) Inversion Bug | FIXED
(3) Add Length Calculation | FIXED

(3) Track Widths to determine segmentation accuracy
(4) Optical Flow

* Currently we have the right number of segments but there are still innacuracies on where
