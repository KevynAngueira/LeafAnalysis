Things to Try:

Original Area:
    (1) DONE | Wrong Base Widths Bug -- Using widths 3-6 rather than 0-2 as our base widths. Changed for user input measurements
    (2) DONE | Simmulated Noise Model -- Model was trained without artificial noise, leading to overfitting and ignoring measurment error
    
Remaining Area:
    (1) DONE | Remaining Lenght Segmentation -- Added remaining length measurements for improved leaf segment detection
    (2) DONE | Displacement Inversion Bug -- Smoothing correction incorrectly flipped displacement direction without inverting image
    (3) DONE | Image Inversion Bug -- Smoothing correction incorrectly inverted image
    (4) DONE | Shape Breakage Bug -- Leaf lifts and overlaps over the frontpiece, breaking the rectangular shape of the view window preventing detection
    (5) DONE | Lost Target Area Bug -- LAB mask treats 0, 0, 0 from lost target as non-black areas, which adds 6.5 are per lost frame

    (6) DONE | Farneback Optical Flow -- Attempted to swap to Farneback Optical Flow, worse results than Template Matching
    (7) DONE | Lucas-Kanade Optical Flow -- Attempted to swap to Lucas Kanade Optical Flow, better than Farneback but still worse Template Matching 
    (8) DONE | Refine Leaf Mask -- Leaf Mask still leaves room for improvement. 
    
    (8) TODO | ????? -- Identify new bugs and think up on new strategies to improve our accuracy
