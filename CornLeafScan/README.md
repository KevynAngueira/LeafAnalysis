LeafScan is a collection of scripts for digitizing long leaves and estimating health metrics.

The goal of LeafScan is to modernize procedures for calculating corn leaf defoliation, specifically after hail weather events.

To accomplish this, LeafScan must be:
(1) Lightweight
(2) Inexpensive
(3) Timely

To do so we developed a procedure using mobile phones and a simple "LeafScan tool", that allow any adjuster and researcher to digitize long leaves and measure damage/other health metrics using commonly available resources. 

The LeafScan Tool is a small portable tool divided into a front and backpiece. The front and backpieces are colored pink and light blue respectively to be easily separate our target leaf from common colors in the field. Moreover, both pieces are separated by a small gap, allowing the user to feed the leaf through, straightening the leaf and separating it from occluding background elements. Lastly the frontpiece has a rectangular cutout region,the view window, from which we can view a given fixed sized section of the leaf at any given time. This tool uses hardware to control for variable in field conditions, facilitating creating a digitized scan of the leaf. 

LeafScan takes a video of slowly sliding a corn leaf through the LeafScan tool, and returns a digitized leaf and defoliation %.
