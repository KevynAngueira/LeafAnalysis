This is a collection of short scripts relating to video processing and computer vision on Digital Agriculture. 

The goal is to scan damaged corn leaves with the help of a real world tool and diagnose defoliation (percentage missing area).

Our design uses a simple tool, a front and backpiece separated by a small gap such that a damaged leaf can be slid through and a rectangle cut out in the frontpiece creating a view window.

The tool design offers the following adavantages:
(1) By sliding the damaged corn leaf between the front and backpiece we can straighten the leaf, avoiding leaf curling and similar issues
(2) The backpiece separates the leaf from background elements (other leaves or corn plants)
(3) The view window is a known size, as such it can be used as a size reference to derive leaf area
